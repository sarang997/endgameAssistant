# 🌟 FEN Position Extractor 🌟

This tool helps you extract **FEN (Forsyth–Edwards Notation)** positions from your games. Once you've set it up and run it, it will generate a `fen.txt` file that contains all the matched FEN positions from your games. Additionally, it will display the desired endgame positions on the terminal.

## 🚀 Installation

1. 🐍 First, make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. 📦 Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. 📍 Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal or command prompt.
4. 📋 Install the required dependencies with the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt


## 🔧 Configuration

Edit the variables in `run.py` as per your requirements.

## 🏃 Running the Tool

Execute the following command:
python run.py

After the script runs successfully, you will find a file named `fen.txt` in the project directory. This file contains all the matched FEN positions from your games. 

🕐 Additionally, once all the games are fetched from the lichess API (please be patient as the API currently returns 20 games per second), a `games.pgn` file will also be generated.

## 📄 Output

Upon successful execution, you should see the desired endgame positions displayed on the terminal.
